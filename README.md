# Tree Survey

Some background to the consultation.

Sheffield City Council have a fat private finance initiative
contract with Amey, and as part of this contract, Amey are in
the middle of cutting down some of Sheffield's trees.

This is a controversial move,
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/06/green-party-councillor-alison-teal-arrested-at-sheffield-tree-protest,
particular with regard to how citizens are consulted,
and the choice of trees to fell, and the manner of felling them.

Any street where street works are proposed is sent a survey
(by letter) and in particular asked:
"do you agree with the proposals for the trees on your street?".
Any streets where 50% or more of the responses do not agree with
the proposals are referred to the independent tree panel.
See
https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/home/roads-pavements/managing-trees
for more details.

Only residents of the streets affected get a say, either in the
survey or in the independent tree panel.
Trees only affect one street (so trees on corners or squares and
such like are "allocated" to one particular street).

When the survey is made, only one response per household is
permitted.

## Comments on survey protocol

The survey is arranged in a peculiar way.
Obviously the caucus that is interested in a tree is more than
the residents of the street on which the tree is situated.
It included residents of nearby streets, offices and businesses,
and even, broadly, members of the general public who are
visiting.
The survey neglects all these considerations and is obviously
deliberately designed to consult basically as narrowly as
possible.

Some streets have 1 or 2 residents (apparently, some have zero),
some have hundreds.
One survey for each street, regardless.

## Questions

Here is a copy of the questions (and our household's answers)
from the survey.

Note that these are taken from my copy of our answers,
and I can no longer tell what the options were for the Matrix 1
questions.
But we can tell that at least `Good` and `Poor` were amongst the
options.
